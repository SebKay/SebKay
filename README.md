## Hey, I’m Seb.

A web designer and developer from Southampton, UK. My preferred tools of choice are PHP, Sass and JS.

I'm currently building an open-source [Slim](http://www.slimframework.com/) starter app, [Noticeable](https://github.com/SebKay/noticeable) and [WP-OOP](https://github.com/SebKay/oop-wp).

⚡ Fun fact: I spend most of my free time renovating my house because coding day and night is overrated.
