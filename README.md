## Hey, I’m Seb.

A web designer and developer from Southampton, UK. I create custom websites to help businesses do better online.

I'm currently working on [Noticeable](https://github.com/SebKay/noticeable) and [WP-OOP](https://github.com/SebKay/oop-wp).

⚡ Fun fact: I spend most of my free time renovating my house because coding your whole life is overrated.
