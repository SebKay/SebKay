# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Seb.

I'm a web developer from Southampton, UK. Currently lead developer at a local agency, @fhoke. In my spare time I enjoy DIY, gaming and building my own projects. My preferred tools are PHP, Laravel and Vue.js.

I'm on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sebkaydesign) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/sebkaydesign/).

## Projects

### [Laravel / Inertia (Vue) â€“ Template](https://github.com/SebKay/laravel-inertia-template)

A template project. My base for building the next idea.
