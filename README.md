## Hey, Iâ€™m Seb.

A web developer from Southampton, UK. My preferred tools are PHP, Vue.js and Sass.

I'm currently building an open source starter app for [Slim 4](http://www.slimframework.com/) called [Slim Starter](https://github.com/SebKay/slim-starter) and a session-based site notice package called [Noticeable](https://github.com/SebKay/noticeable).
